## 🚀 Setup
For a minimal setup, the server requirements are:
- At least 512MB memory
- At least a single core CPU
- Docker, you can install it with your distro's package manager

The docker image is a quite big one (~1GB) so this command may take a while:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8082           \
    -e VENOM_ALLINT=true           \
    -e VENOM_URL=http://<ip>       \
    -v $PWD/db:/venom/server/db    \
    -v $PWD/tor:/var/lib/tor/venom \
    ghcr.io/ngn13/venom:latest
```
Then checkout the logs for the server (`docker logs <id>`) to learn the onion
address, so you can access the interface over TOR. Please check out the [docs](docs/advanced.md)
for a more advanced setup.
